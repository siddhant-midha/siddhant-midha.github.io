I was a teaching assistant with Prof. Saurav Bhaumik & Prof. Bata K. Das in MA 111: Calculus II at IIT Bombay in AY2021. I conducted weekly tutorial sessions. Below, one can find the (handwritten) notes on the tutorials, as well as the some stuff written up in TeX. The "TSC" slides originate from _tutorial service center_ sessions that I took for the entire freshman batch.
