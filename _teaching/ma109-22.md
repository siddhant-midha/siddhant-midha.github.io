### Extra Material 

1. We talked about finite sets, and briefly about the cardinality of infinite sets. We defined countable sets using bijection with $$\mathbb{N}$$. We left the discussion with the claim that there exists no bijection between $$(0,1)$$ and $$\mathbb{N}$$. This is shown using *Cantor's Argument*. One can read [this](https://jlmartin.ku.edu/courses/math410-S09/cantor.pdf) document to learn more.
