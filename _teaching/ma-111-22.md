I was a teaching assistant with Prof. Preeti Raman & Prof. Niranjan Balachandran in MA 111: Calculus II at IIT Bombay in AY2021. Herein, I was the head TA and mostly assisted in an administrative capacity. I did take a TSC session for the freshman batch, but my material can be found in the [AY21](https://siddhantmidha.com/teaching/ma-111-21/) page, from the previous year I taught this course.
