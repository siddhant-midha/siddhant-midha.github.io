	abstract = {Harnessing topological phases with their dissipationless edge-channels coupled with the effective engineering of quantum phase transitions is a spinal aspect of topological electronics. The accompanying symmetry protection leads to different kinds of topological edge-channels which include, for instance, the quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase, and the spin quantum anomalous Hall (SQAH) phase. To model realistic devices, it is important to ratify the robustness of the dissipationless edge-channels, which should typically exhibit a perfect quantum of conductance, against various disorder and dephasing. This work is hence devoted to a computational exploration of topological robustness against various forms of dephasing. For this, we employ phenomenological dephasing models under the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism using a model topological device setup on a 2D-Xene platform. Concurrently, we also explicitly add disorder via impurity potentials in the channel and averaging over hundreds of configurations. To describe the extent of robustness, we quantify the decay of the conductance quantum with increasing disorder under different conditions. Our analysis shows that these topological phases are robust to experimentally relevant regimes of momentum dephasing and random disorder potentials. We note that Rashba mixing worsens the performance of the QSH phase and point out a mechanism for the same. Further, we observe that the QSH phase break downs due to spin dephasing, but the SQAH phase remains robust. The SQAH phase shows stark robustness under all the dephasing regimes, and shows promise for realistic device structures for topological electronics applications.},

	abstract = {Quantum diamond microscopy using nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) defects in diamond crystals has enabled the magnetic field imaging of a wide variety of nanoscale current profiles. Intimately linked with the imaging process is the problem of reconstructing the current density, which provides critical insight into the structure under study. This manifests as a nontrivial inverse problem of current reconstruction from noisy data, typically conducted via Fourier-based approaches. Learning algorithms and Bayesian methods have been proposed as novel alternatives for inference-based reconstructions. We study the applicability of Fourier-based and Bayesian methods for reconstructing two-dimensional current density maps from magnetic field images obtained from N-V imaging. We discuss extensive numerical simulations to elucidate the performance of the reconstruction algorithms in various parameter regimes, and further validate our analysis by performing reconstructions on experimental data. Finally, we examine parameter regimes that favor specific reconstruction algorithms and provide an empirical approach for selecting regularization in Bayesian methods.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments on Cooper pair splitters using superconductor-quantum dot hybrids have embarked on creating entanglement in the solid-state, by engineering the sub-gap processes in the superconducting region. Using the thermoelectric Cooper pair splitter setup [Nat. Comm., 12, 21, (2021)] as a prototype, we develop a detailed analysis of the observed transport signal to bring out vital insights into the regimes of operation and establish the non-local nature of the correlations arising from the crossed Andreev processes. As a striking consequence, contact induced level broadening of the quantum dot's discrete energy spectrum and its hybridization with the superconducting segment, results in a parity reversal of the thermoelectric current along with shifted resonances of the crossed Andreev processes. We conclusively establish the presence of non-local correlations by making a clear nexus with quantum discord. Our detailed analysis thereby provides insights into the gate voltage control of the entanglement generation in superconducting-hybrid Cooper pair splitters.},

	abstract = {Integer factorization is a significant problem, with implications for the security of widely-used cryptographic schemes. No efficient classical algorithm for polynomial-time integer factorization has been found despite extensive research. Although Peter Shor’s breakthrough quantum algorithm offers a viable solution, current limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers hinder its practical implementation. To address this, researchers have explored alternative methods for factorization suitable for NISQ devices. One such method is the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which treats factoring as an optimization problem defined over binary bits, resulting in various problematic aspects. In this paper, we explore the Func-QAOA approach for factorization, which premises overcoming some of the limitations of previous approaches and allows the incorporation of more advanced factorization techniques. After reviewing the most promising quantum implementations for integer arithmetics, we present a few illustrative examples to demonstrate the efficacy of the Func-QAOA approach and discuss methods to reduce the search space to speed up the optimization process.},
