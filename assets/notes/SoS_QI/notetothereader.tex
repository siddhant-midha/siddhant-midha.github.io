\section*{Note to the Reader}
This report is intended to formalize concretely the concepts of quantum information. The main references are
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Theory of Quantum Information by John Watrous.
    \item Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by M. Nielson and I. Chuang.
    \item From Classical to Quantum Shannon Theory by Mark Wilde.
\end{itemize}
Due to a stubborn affection for the dirac notation, I have used the same whenever denoting vectors in a space. For giving additionaly physics intuition, I have also added boxes titled \textit{Physics Fact}, which attempt to draw the reader's attention to connect the dots.
