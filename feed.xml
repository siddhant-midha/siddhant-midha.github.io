These are just guidelines which hopefully will be helpful in crafting your own Ph.D. journey.

You could be a first- or second-year undergrad starting to get into research, or a final year undergrad close to the applications deadline. Keeping this in mind, I’ll take a bottom-up approach and try my best to start from the beginning.</p> <h2 id="first-year-of-your-undergrad">First-year of your undergrad</h2> <p>Depending on how one likes to do and plan things, this might be too early to actually start doing anything research wise, but I’ll still talk about some things that might be helpful.</p>]]></content><author><name>Siddhant</name></author><category term="distill"/><category term="formatting"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[a mini-guide]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https://siddhantmidha.com/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https://siddhantmidha.com/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://siddhantmidha.com/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry></feed>
