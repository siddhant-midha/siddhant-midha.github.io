  abstract = {Recent experiments on Cooper pair splitters using superconductor-quantum dot hybrids have embarked on creating entanglement in the solid-state, by engineering the sub-gap processes in the superconducting region. Using the thermoelectric Cooper pair splitter setup [Nat. Comm., 12, 21, (2021)] as a prototype, we present a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental components of the observed transport signal, aiming to critically clarify the operating regimes and confirm the nonlocal and nonclassical nature of correlations arising from crossed Andreev processes. By making a nexus with quantum discord, we identify operating points of nonlocal quantum correlations in the CPS device—information that cannot be extracted from the transport signal alone. A notable consequence of our analysis is the finding that contact-induced level broadening of the quantum dot’s discrete energy spectrum, along with its hybridization with the superconducting segment, can lead to shifted resonances in the crossed Andreev process as well as a parity reversal in the thermoelectric current. Our work thereby provides detailed insights into the gate voltage control of the quantum correlations in superconducting-hybrid Cooper pair splitters, revealing new avenues for harnessing quantum correlations in solid-state systems.},

  abstract = {Harnessing topological phases with their dissipationless edge-channels coupled with the effective engineering of quantum phase transitions is a spinal aspect of topological electronics. The accompanying symmetry protection leads to different kinds of topological edge-channels which include, for instance, the quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase, and the spin quantum anomalous Hall (SQAH) phase. To model realistic devices, it is important to ratify the robustness of the dissipationless edge-channels, which should typically exhibit a perfect quantum of conductance, against various disorder and dephasing. This work is hence devoted to a computational exploration of topological robustness against various forms of dephasing. For this, we employ phenomenological dephasing models under the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism using a model topological device setup on a 2D-Xene platform. Concurrently, we also explicitly add disorder via impurity potentials in the channel and averaging over hundreds of configurations. To describe the extent of robustness, we quantify the decay of the conductance quantum with increasing disorder under different conditions. Our analysis shows that these topological phases are robust to experimentally relevant regimes of momentum dephasing and random disorder potentials. We note that Rashba mixing worsens the performance of the QSH phase and point out a mechanism for the same. Further, we observe that the QSH phase break downs due to spin dephasing, but the SQAH phase remains robust. The SQAH phase shows stark robustness under all the dephasing regimes, and shows promise for realistic device structures for topological electronics applications.},

  abstract = {Quantum diamond microscopy using nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) defects in diamond crystals has enabled the magnetic field imaging of a wide variety of nanoscale current profiles. Intimately linked with the imaging process is the problem of reconstructing the current density, which provides critical insight into the structure under study. This manifests as a nontrivial inverse problem of current reconstruction from noisy data, typically conducted via Fourier-based approaches. Learning algorithms and Bayesian methods have been proposed as novel alternatives for inference-based reconstructions. We study the applicability of Fourier-based and Bayesian methods for reconstructing two-dimensional current density maps from magnetic field images obtained from N-V imaging. We discuss extensive numerical simulations to elucidate the performance of the reconstruction algorithms in various parameter regimes, and further validate our analysis by performing reconstructions on experimental data. Finally, we examine parameter regimes that favor specific reconstruction algorithms and provide an empirical approach for selecting regularization in Bayesian methods.},

  abstract = {Integer factorization is a significant problem, with implications for the security of widely-used cryptographic schemes. No efficient classical algorithm for polynomial-time integer factorization has been found despite extensive research. Although Peter Shor's breakthrough quantum algorithm offers a viable solution, current limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers hinder its practical implementation. To address this, researchers have explored alternative methods for factorization suitable for NISQ devices. One such method is the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which treats factoring as an optimization problem defined over binary bits, resulting in various problematic aspects. In this paper, we explore the Func-QAOA approach for factorization, which premises overcoming some of the limitations of previous approaches and allows the incorporation of more advanced factorization techniques. After reviewing the most promising quantum implementations for integer arithmetics, we present a few illustrative examples to demonstrate the efficacy of the Func-QAOA approach and discuss methods to reduce the search space to speed up the optimization process.},

  abstract = {Investigating the microscopic details of the proximity effect is crucial for both key experimental applications and fundamental inquiries into nanoscale devices featuring superconducting elements. In this work, we develop a framework motivated by experiments to study induced superconducting correlations in hybrid nanoscale devices featuring layered superconductor-normal heterostructures using the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's functions. Following a detailed method for analyzing the induced pair amplitude in a prototypical one-dimensional hybrid, we provide insights into the proximity effect within and outside the Andreev approximation. Our analysis also uncovers a disorder-induced crossover in the correlation patterns of the system. By elucidating the spectral distribution of the induced pair amplitude, we investigate the pair correlations established in a recent experiment [Phys.Rev.Lett.128,127701], providing a theoretical basis for the enhanced Cooper pair injection demonstrated through the lens of the induced pair correlations, thereby establishing the promise of our methods in guiding new experiments in hybrid quantum devices.},
