Almost everyone is aware of some sort of idea of machine learning. People have seen the successes of deep learning. But, with that, there has been a loss in interpretation of models such as deep neural networks. In this project, I and [Prateek Garg](https://github.com/prateekgargX) aim to understand some theory and implement some ideas to try to answer the question of interpretability. 

The work can be found [here](https://github.com/prateekgargX/Visualizing-Neural-Networks).
