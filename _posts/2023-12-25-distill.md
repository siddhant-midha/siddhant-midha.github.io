# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).

    # if a section has subsections, you can add them as follows:
    # subsections:
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 1
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 2

## Fermionic Systems

1. [Entanglement in a free fermion chain under continuous monitoring](scipost.org/SciPostPhys.7.2.024/pdf)
2. [Growth of entanglement entropy under local projective measurements](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10837.pdf): If $1/\tau$ is the measurement rate, then these guys show that for a fermionic chain with PBC and monitoring of local number operator, then the critical time $\tau_c$ for the switchover from area to volume law diverges with the length, hence the thermodynamic limit would only exhibit an area-law of the saturated EE!
