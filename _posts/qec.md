Important papers in quantum error correction.

- [Quantum data processing and error correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9604022): _Perfect error correction is possible iff the coherent information equals initial entropy, i.e.,_ $I(R:E') = 0$. Terms like coherent information, entropy exchange, and entanglement fidelity are defined, and a data processing inequality on the coherent information is stated.
