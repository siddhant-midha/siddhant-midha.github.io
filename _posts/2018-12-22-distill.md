## Workshop: Machine Learning for the Physical Sciences (Neurips 2023)

I recall seeing some interesting VQA papers as well as machine learning for many-body papers in MLPS 2022, so thought to check out [2023](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2023/). Here are the ones I shall be reading:

1. [**Variational quantum dynamics of two-dimensional rotor models**](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2023/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2023_40.pdf)
2. [**Discovering Quantum Circuits for Logical State Preparation with Deep Reinforcement Learning**](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2023/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2023_84.pdf)
3. [**Discovering Quantum Error Correcting Codes with Deep Reinforcement Learning**](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2023/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2023_83.pdf)


## arXiv papers

1. [**Entanglement-magic separation in hybrid quantum circuits**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02039.pdf). TLDR: Take the MIPT brickwork, sprinkle random T-gates at each time-step (after the measurements) with a probability density 

$$
p_T \sim \frac{\eta}{N^{\beta}}, ~ \beta \neq 0
$$

one finds that there are _two_ phase transitions, one is the 'normal' MIPT, and one is a phase transition in the magic (distance of a state from the nearest stabilizer, the non-Cliffordness). Interesting.
