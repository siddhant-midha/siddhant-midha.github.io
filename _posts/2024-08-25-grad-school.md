# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).

    # if a section has subsections, you can add them as follows:
    # subsections:
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 1
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 2

## Disclaimer
All of the content below is a result of my experience with grad school applications, and is by no means a complete or correct set of rules one needs to follow. These are just guidelines which hopefully will be helpful in crafting your own Ph.D. journey. And with that said, while most of what I say is catered to  _Ph.D. applications in the U.S.A._, some things might be generalized to M.S. applications, and Ph.D. applications elsewhere.


# Introduction

As a reader of this page, you might be in one of many stages possible vis-Ã -vis grad applications, but all of those stages reasonably converge into making sure you get into one of the suitable grad schools to do your research. You could be a first- or second-year undergrad starting to get into research, or a final year undergrad close to the applications deadline. Keeping this in mind, I'll take a bottom-up approach and try my best to start from the beginning. 

## First-year of your undergrad

Depending on how one likes to do and plan things, this might be too early to actually start doing anything research wise, but I'll still talk about some things that might be helpful.
