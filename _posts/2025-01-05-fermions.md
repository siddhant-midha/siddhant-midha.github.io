## Fermions
In the language of second quantization, we describe fermions in terms of the annhilation $$c$$ and creation operators $$c^\dagger$$. Consider a system of $$N$$ fermionic modes. Then, the anti-commutation relations are as follows: 
\begin{equation}
\{c_i,c_j^\dagger \} = \delta_{ij},~ \{c_i^\dagger,c_j^\dagger\} = 0,~ \{c_i,c_j\} = 0
\end{equation}
The corresponding Majorana operators are defined as,
\begin{equation}
\gamma_i := (a_i + a_i^\dagger),~~\bar{\gamma}_i := -\iota (a_i - a_i^\dagger)
\end{equation}
These objects are Hermitian, $$\gamma = \gamma^\dagger$$ and $$\bar{\gamma} = \bar{\gamma}^\dagger$$, and they satisfy the following anti-commutation relations,
\begin{equation}
\{\gamma_i,\gamma_j\} = 2\delta_{ij} 
\end{equation}
Another interesting object to define in terms of the Majorana operators are _edge_ and _vertex_ operators. For each $$i,j \in [N]$$, 
\begin{equation}
E_{ij} := -\iota \gamma_i\gamma_j,~~ V_j:= -\iota \gamma_j \bar{\gamma}_j
\end{equation}
These objects are Hermitian, traceless, and self-inverse. They obey a nice graph-theoretic notion of (anti-)commutativity. That is, if a vertex is shared among these objects, they anticommute. If they are disjoint, they commute. 
\begin{equation}
\{E_{jk},V_j\} = 0, ~~ \{E_{ij},E_{jk}\} = 0 
\end{equation}
and if $$(i,j,k,l)$$ are all distinct, then 
\begin{equation}
[V_i,V_j] = 0,~~ [E_{ij},V_k] = 0, ~~ [E_{ij},E_{kl}] = 0.
\end{equation}
