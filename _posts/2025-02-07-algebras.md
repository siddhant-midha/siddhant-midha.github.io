An algebra is a vector space with more to do with. Formally, if $$V$$ is a vector space over the field $$\mathbb{F}$$, then an algebra $$\mathcal{A}$$ over $$\mathbb{F}$$ is the vector space together with a bilinear multiplication operation defined on it, $$\mathcal{A} = 
(F,\cdot)$$ with $$\cdot: V\times V \to V$$, $$(a,b) \mapsto a\cdot b \equiv ab$$ for $$a,b\in V$$. The multiplication is usually associative, $$a(bc) = (ab)c$$, hence usally the algebras are associative algebras. 

- A norm $$||\cdot||$$ on $$\mathcal{A}$$ is said to be _submultiplicative_ if $$||ab|| \leq ||a|| \cdot ||b||$$. If so, the pair $$(\mathcal{A},||\cdot||)$$ is a _normed_ algebra. 
- If further $$\mathcal{A}$$ admits a unit element, satisfying $$a1 = 1a = a$$ and $$||1|| = 1$$ we say that $$\mathcal{A}$$ is a _unital_ normed algebra. 
- As a reminder, a normed vector space in which every Cauchy sequence converges (w.r.t. that norm) is called complete. A complete normed vector space is a Banach space (if the norm is induced by an inner product, we have a Hilbert space.)
- Naturally, a complete normed algebra is called a Banach algebra.

For a unital algebra, say that an element $$a\in\mathcal{A}$$ is invertible if there exists a $$b\in\mathcal{A}$$ such that $$ab = ba = 1$$. The set of invertible elements $$\text{Inv}(\mathcal{A})$$ of a unital algebra is a group under multiplication. Now, we can define the _spectrum_ of an element $$a\in\mathcal{A}$$ in a unital algebra as follows (note that we don't need the element to "act" on anything)

\begin{equation}
  \sigma(a) := \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} \mid \lambda 1 - a \not\in\text{Inv}(\mathcal{A})\}
\end{equation}

Now, we can impose some more structure, because why not. An _involution_ $$*$$ on an algebra is a conjugate-linear map $$a\mapsto a^*$$ such that $$a^{**} = a$$ and $$(ab)^* = b^* a^*$$. The pair $$(\mathcal{A},*)$$ is an involutive-algebra or a $$*$$-algebra. 

- A subset is said to be self-adjoint if $$a\in S \implies a^*\in S$$. 
- An element $$a\in \mathcal{A}$$ is _normal_ if $$aa^* = a^* a$$. 
- $$p \in \mathcal{A}$$ is a _projection_ if $$p = p^* = p^2$$. 
- $$u \in \mathcal{A}$$ is _unitary_ if $$uu^* = u^*u = 1$$. 


A _Banach algebra_ is a $$*$$-algebra with a complete, submultiplicative norm which obeys $$||a|| = ||a^*||$$. A $$C^*$$-algebra is a Banach $$*$$-algebra obeying 
\begin{equation}
  ||a^*a|| = ||a||^2.
\end{equation}
