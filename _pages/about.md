I am currently a first-year graduate student at [Princeton Quantum Initiative](https://quantum.princeton.edu/people/siddhant-midha), Princeton University. Previously, I studied electrical engineering, physics, and just a bit of CS at IIT Bombay, in India. You can find me at Friend Center (FC309), or frequently juggling between EQuad and Jadwin.


I am interested in studying the dynamics of quantum information, and quantum technology in general.

I find myself fascinated by problems at the interface of quantum info, condensed matter, and quantum optics. I also like thinking about machine learning, and complexity theory sometimes.
