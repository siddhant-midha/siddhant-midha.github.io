I am currently a first-year graduate student at [Princeton Quantum Initiative](https://quantum.princeton.edu/people/siddhant-midha), Princeton University. I am co-advised by [Sarang Gopalakrishnan](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/sarang-gopalakrishnan) and [Dima Abanin](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/dmitry-abanin). 



Previously, I studied electrical engineering, physics, and just a bit of CS at IIT Bombay, India. Now, you can find me in Princeton at EQuad C319E, or frequently juggling between EQuad and Jadwin.


I am interested in studying the dynamics of quantum information, and quantum technology in general.


I find myself fascinated by problems at the interface of quantum info, condensed matter, and quantum optics. I also like thinking about machine learning, and complexity theory sometimes.


If you are an IITB student, the material on the [teaching](https://siddhantmidha.com/teaching/) page might be useful. If you are a person interested in learning more about quantum information, [this](https://github.com/VedangAsgaonkar/Quantum-Machine-Learning-SoC2022?tab=readme-ov-file) may be useful. I'm always happy to respond to emails, feel free to reach out!
