I am currently a first-year graduate student at [Princeton Quantum Initiative](https://quantum.princeton.edu/people/siddhant-midha), Princeton University. I am co-advised by [Sarang Gopalakrishnan](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/sarang-gopalakrishnan) and [Dima Abanin](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/dmitry-abanin). 



Previously, I studied electrical engineering, physics, and just a bit of CS at IIT Bombay, India. Now, you can find me in Princeton at EQuad C319E, or frequently juggling between EQuad and Jadwin.


I am interested in studying the dynamics of quantum information, and quantum technology in general.

I find myself fascinated by problems at the interface of quantum info, condensed matter, and quantum optics. I also like thinking about machine learning, and complexity theory sometimes.



_Note for undergrads interested in quantum research_. It is usually a good idea to reach out to graduate students working on things you're interested in, and potentially gain some research experience by collaborating with them. Grad students have more ideas than time on their hands --- if you are numerically proficient and/or theoretically advanced, reach out to discuss ideas!
