I am currently a second-year graduate student at [Princeton Quantum Initiative](https://quantum.princeton.edu/people/siddhant-midha), Princeton University. I am co-advised by [Sarang Gopalakrishnan](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/sarang-gopalakrishnan) and [Dima Abanin](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/dmitry-abanin). I graduated from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2024.

My research spans a network of ideas at the intersection of quantum information science and condensed-matter physics. I am currently thinking about:

- **Quantum Simulation and Dynamics:** I study the non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum systems. Central questions are: *what* kind of complex phenomenon emerge under evolution governed by local interactions, *when* can we simulate such dynamics classically, and *when* do we fundamentally require a quantum computer? Tensor networks provide a rich theoretical and algorithmic playground.

- **Quantum Error Correction:** Building theoretical tools that move us toward the next generation of *fault-tolerant* quantum computers. I’m particularly interested in "efficient" decoders that properly handle quantum *degeneracy*, the information-theoretic limits that constrain them, and the underlying physics that governs these bounds.

- **Quantum Sensing:** Quantum systems are fragile, but that fragility can be turned into sensitivity. I’m interested in how to design controllable quantum devices that serve as precision sensors: what are the information-theoretic limits on their sensitivity, and what kind of phenomenon can be probed? Conversely, can tools from quantum metrology offer new ways to characterize phases of matter and dynamical phenomena?

If you are an IITB student, the material on the [teaching](https://siddhantmidha.com/teaching/) page might be useful.
