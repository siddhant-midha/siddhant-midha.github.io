Hello! Currently, I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India. I do a lot of physics and computer science, hence landed up in EE. You can find me in Room 7109, Hostel 17, or in the Electrical and/or Physics departments most often. I am also frequently found sipping coffee at Cafe 92 or CCD.

I am interested in all things quantum -- my work has revolved around quantum information and computation theory, condensed matter physics, and quantum optics. Particularly, I find myself fascinated by problems at the intersection of two or more of these fields. I also quite like quantum machine learning, and topics revolving around that. This is perhaps linked to the QIC interest coupled with an inherent curiousity about the nature of systems which can learn.

Outside of academia and research, I like listening to music -- my taste is, like my work, interdisciplinary :P; from thrash metal (say, Iron Maiden) to some jazz and baritones (say, Louis Armstrong), I listen throughout the spectrum. I also play guitar, and am not a very terrible singer (I think). I love reading books!


My research interests lie in and around the following 

- Quantum Computation and Information
- Quantum Technologies: Quantum Sensing, Topological Quantum Electronics
- Machine Learning and Statistical Learning Theory

Apart from that, I enjoy playing the guitar a lot. I try to sing. Movies and TV shows are a favourite pastime. Recently, I took an interest in hiking and I have enjoyed that quite a lot. I also try to find the time to swim sometimes.
