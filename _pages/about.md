Hello! I am currently a first-year graduate student in the [Quantum Sciences and Engineering](https://quantum.princeton.edu/) department at Princeton University. Previously, I studied electrical engineering, physics, and just a bit of CS at IIT Bombay, in India. You can find me at Friend Center (FC309), or frequently juggling between EQuad and Jadwin.


I am interested in many-body quantum information, and quantum technology in general.

I find myself fascinated by problems at the interface of quantum info, condensed matter, and quantum optics. I also like thinking about machine learning, and am trying to develop a 'physical' perspective for it.


Outside of academia and research, I like listening to music -- my taste is, like my work, interdisciplinary :P; from thrash metal (say, Iron Maiden) to some jazz and baritones (say, Louis Armstrong), I listen throughout the spectrum. I also play guitar, and am not a very terrible singer (I think). I love reading books!



If you're looking for my CV, find a pdf [here](https://siddhant-midha.github.io/cv/), and a more up-to-date overleaf [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fprrbwkfrbcj#7b5c64). Stuff I have taught is [here](https://siddhant-midha.github.io/teaching/), and some projects [here](https://siddhant-midha.github.io/projects/).
