Hello! I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India. You can find me in Room 7109, Hostel 17, or in the Electrical and/or Physics departments most often. I am also frequently found sipping coffee at Cafe 92 or CCD.


I am interested in all things quantum. My research interests lie in and around the following

- Quantum Information
- Condensed Matter Physics
- Quantum Optics

Particularly, I find myself fascinated by problems at the intersection of two or more of these fields. I also quite like quantum machine learning, and topics revolving around that. I enjoy thinking about problems in quantum dynamics which hold information/coding theortic aspects as well.

Outside of academia and research, I like listening to music -- my taste is, like my work, interdisciplinary :P; from thrash metal (say, Iron Maiden) to some jazz and baritones (say, Louis Armstrong), I listen throughout the spectrum. I also play guitar, and am not a very terrible singer (I think). I love reading books!
